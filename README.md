# GeneticAlgorithm
Refactoring and improving a gist from Ms Vijini Mallawaarachchi ( [@Vini2](https://github.com/Vini2) )  
I also took the edit of [@liangyihuai](https://github.com/liangyihuai) into account.  
  
For this software I'll take a [gist](https://gist.github.com/Vini2/bd22b36ddc69c5327097921f5118b709#file-simpledemoga-java) from Mrs Vijini Mallawaarachchi (@Vini2) and iteratively refactor it with some of the best practices in the software industry. However, I kept the lab "sensation", hence, She could keep experimenting in the public static void mail method ;)  
  
I won't use fancy external lib such as for logging as I want Mrs Vijini Mallawaarachchi and her datascience readers to easily clone the repository and run it with no maven/gradle dependency to install.  
  
This is my gift to her for her very interrresting [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-genetic-algorithms-including-example-code-e396e98d8bf3).  
  
This repo focuses on :  
- Object Oriented Programming refactoring (if this work ins't done and she wants to continue improving her program, she'll find it harder to reuse the code if the structure is wobbly)  
- adding usefull and nice customizable printouts  
- going forward (I'try to add some more features I have in mind, relative to her genetic algorithm :) )
